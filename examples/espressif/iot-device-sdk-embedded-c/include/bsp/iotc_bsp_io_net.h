/**
 * \mainpage IoTC Board Support Package (BSP)
 *
 * # Welcome
 * This doxygen catalogs the Board Support Package (BSP), an abstracted
 * framework for hosting all of the platform-specific code used by the
 * Google Cloud IoT Device SDK for Embedded C (IoTC).
 *
 * Porting engineers should focus most of their work to a custom
 * implementation of these collection of files. The rest of the
 * IoTC client sources, such as the event system, mqtt serializer, and
 * callback system, use platform generic C code that should not need
 * tailoring to specific device SDKs.
 *
 * # Out of the Box
 * The IoTC Client includes a POSIX implementation of the BSP
 * which it uses by default on Linux desktops and devices.
 * For non POSIX platforms your will need to customize the reference
 * implementation, or begin one from scratch.
 *
 * More information on the porting process can be found
 * in the IoTC Porting Guide which resides in the main /doc directory
 * of this project.
 *
 * # Browsing the Sources
 * The BSP is segmented into several distinct files, each focused
 * around a particular platform library requirement:
 *  - Crypto (IoT Core JWT Signing)
 *  - Networking
 *  - Memory Allocators / Dealloactors
 *  - Random Number Generator
 *  - Time
 *  - Transport Layer Security (TLS)
 *  - File System (For Cert Storage, Optional)

 *
 * The best place to start would be the NET BSP to couple the IoTC Client to
 * your device's networking SDK and Crypto to use your TLS or secure chip
 * library to sign a JWT with a private key.
 *
 * Implementations for Time, Rng and Memory should be highly
 * portable and might not need any customization at all.
 *
 * # TLS BSPs
 * The IoTC Client also ships with support for two TLS implementations
 * out of the box:
 *
 * ## &nbsp;mbedTLS <small>(https://tls.mbed.org)</small>
 * The default make target will download a tagged mbedTLS release from
 * their repository, and build it to link against. Additionally the
 * IoTC Client Sources will be configured to build the its TLS BSP
 * for mbedTLS which resides in: <code>/src/bsp/mbedtls</code>.
 *
 * ## &nbsp;wolfSSL <small>(https://www.wolfssl.com/)</small>
 * The client also has a reference TLS BSP implementation for wolfSSL,
 * another TLS library designed for embedded devices.
 *
 * Please see our User Guide and Porting Guide for more information on
 * how to configure the client to use these different TLS implementations.
 * Both documents reside in the base <code>/doc</code> directory.
 *
 * This should get you up and running quickly but their sources must be
 * licensed for distribution.

/**
 * @file iotc_bsp_io_net.h
 * @brief IoTC Client's Board Support Platform (BSP) for Asynchronous Networking
 *
 * This file defines the API of an asynchronous platform specific networking
 * implementation. These are all the functions one should implement to couple
 * the IoTC client to the device's networking SDK.
 *
 * These functions should be implemented in a non-blocking fashion.
 * This means that these function should fit into a coopeartive-multitasking
 * environment of the IoTC client, which is designed not to block on any
 * one operation.
 *
 * A device connecting to the Could IoT Core service would have a standard
 * flow looks like the following:
 *   1. create_socket
 *   2. connect
 *   3. connection_check
 *   4. Iterations of read-write operations
 *   5. close_socket when the application shuts down the connection.

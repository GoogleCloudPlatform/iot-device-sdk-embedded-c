Tinytest is a tiny little test framework written in C by Nick Mathewson.

It is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license.  You can use it in
your own programs so long as you follow the license's conditions.

It's been tested on Windows, Mac, and many of the free Unixes.

It knows how to fork before running certain tests, and it makes
text-mode output in a format I like.

For info on how to use it, check out tinytest_demo.c.

You can get the latest version using Git, by pulling from
   git://github.com/nmathewson/tinytest.git

Patches are welcome. Patches that turn this from tinytest to hugetest
will not be applied.  If you want a huge test framework, use CUnit.

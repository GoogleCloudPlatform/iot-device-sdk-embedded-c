 * driver codec layer:
 * Main purpose is two folded: first is to encode C struct data
 * to binary format to make an IO layer able to forward message
 * to the other side. Second is to decode incoming binary data
 * to C struct to notify driver logic layer about incoming messages.
 *
 * Google's protobuf solution is applied in this version as
 * an encoder / decoder.

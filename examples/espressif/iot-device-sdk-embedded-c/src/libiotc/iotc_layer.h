/* The interface of a layer which combines both: simplicity and
 * functionality of the 'on demand processing' idea.
 *
 * This design is based on the assumption that the communication with the
 * server is bidirectional and the data is processed in chunks/packets. This
 * interface design is generic and allows us to implement different protcols,
 * serialization, and tls operations when can translate the data before it
 * progressing to the subsequent layer. All data handling options are contained
 * within the layer and are an extension of the basic operations of a push/pull
 * interface.
 *
 * In a very basic sense the client sends some bytes to the server and then it
 * waits for the response. After receiving the response, it is passed by to the
 * processing layer through its pull function. This signals the processing layer
 * that there is new data to process.
 *
 * push = data to written
 * pull = data to be read
 *
 * Please note that for the IoTC Client, layers have an notion that other layers
 * exist, with there being both a NEXT layer and a PREVIOUS layer. If you were
 * to map the stack of layers, these two terms are always from the vantage point
 * of the network socket.  That is, data coming from the network will be pushed
 * to the NEXT layer, continuing through each layer to decrypt, parse out the
 * MQTT message which is then acted upon, including incoming messages which may
 * be sent all the way to the Client Application.  PREVIOUS layers are ones
 * which lie closer to the Networking socket than the current layer does.
 *
 * The term 'on demand processing' refers to the fact that the system is driven
 * by the netowkr connection with the notion that incoming data from the network
 * is a catalyst for operations, as are events that are enqueud by the Client
 * Application. If neither of these two events occur, then the client lies
 * nearly dormant (save for a keep alive task timer which periodically sends
 * PINGREQ MQTT messages.)

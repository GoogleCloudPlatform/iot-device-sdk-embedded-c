/**
 * \enum iotc_memory_type_t
 * \brief describes the memory type so that datastructures know
 * if it should manage ( release / clean ) memory by itself or leave
 * it as it is.
 *
 * IOTC_MEMORY_TYPE_UNKNOWN - should be used as a guard, whenever the status
 * is unset this is mostly for default argument assigment protection
 *
 * IOTC_MEMORY_TYPE_MANAGED - buffer memory will be freed whenever destroy is
 * called.
 *
 * IOTC_MEMORY_TYPE_UNMANAGED - buffer memory is not managed by the entity.
 * Therefore the buffer will not be freed whenever destroy is called.

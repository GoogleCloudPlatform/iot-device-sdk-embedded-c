 *
 * This file defines the Time Functions API used by the IoTC Client.
 *
 * The IoTC Client determines time using these functions. These time functions
 * drive the exact execution time of scheduled tasks and the delayed
 * reconnection logic (aka Backoff) which prevents clients from overloading
 * the Google Cloud IoT Core Server. The implementation should use hardware
 * or NTP servers in order to maintain an accurate clock.

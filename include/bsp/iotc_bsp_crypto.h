/**
 * @file iotc_bsp_crypto.h
 * @brief IoTC Client's Board Support Package (BSP) for using a Cryptography
 * library implementation to encode and sign portions of clients Google Cloud
 * IoT Core JWT credential.
 *
 * This file defines the API of a Crypto Board Support Package (BSP) that the
 * IoTC Client would use to generate and sign a JWT using ECC keys and SHA256
 * digests, and formatting results in a URL-Safe Base64 string.
 *
 * The BSP has been created in a way that allows for flexibility in
 * implementation. The private key data and/or private key slot number
 * provided in the iotc_connect call is provided for your use here, and one
 * or both may be NULL depending on your Client Application and your
 * implementation of this BSP.
 *
 * Note that this implementation need not worry about how to format the JWT
 * itself, as this has been already done by the IoTC Client internal library.
 *
 * These functions should return one of the Crypto BSP enumerated states
 * defined in iotc_bsp_crypto_state_t to report success or failures.

/**
 * @file iotc_bsp_rng.h
 * @brief IoTC Client's Board Support Platform (BSP) for Random Number Generator
 *
 * This file defines the Random Number Generator API needed by the IoTC Client.
 *
 * The IoTC Client calls the init function before requesting any random number.
 * The iotc_bsp_rng_get function's responsibility is to provide a random number
 * each time it is called. The shutdown function will be called in case no
 * further random numbers are required by the library. This happens at library
 * shutdown.
 *
 * Note that the values returned here should be as random as possible -- the
 * BackOff system is dependent on these values to prevent accidental DDoS
 * attacks by randomly distributing fleet-wide reconnection attempts.
 * Please do not hardcode a seed value for all of your devices, and please,
 * whenever possible, use a entropy-based hardware random number generator.

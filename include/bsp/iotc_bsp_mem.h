 *
 * This file defines the Memory Management API used by the IoTC Client.
 *
 * The IoTC Client manages memory through these functions. By implementing these

 * For instance a custom implementation can use static memory on devices where
 * heap isn't desired. Another use case might be memory tracking by injecting
 * metrics into the implementation.
